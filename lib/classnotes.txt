Classes and Objects: The code defines a Shoe class, which serves as a blueprint for creating shoe objects.

Constructor (__init__ method): The __init__ method is the constructor of the Shoe class. It initializes the attributes of a shoe object when it is created.

Instance Variables: The code uses instance variables (brand, size, condition) to store object-specific data for each shoe object.

Properties and Getters/Setters: The @property decorator and the corresponding setter method are used to define a getter and setter for the size attribute, allowing controlled access and modification of the attribute.

Instance Methods: The cobble method is an instance method of the Shoe class. It represents the action of repairing a shoe and updates the condition attribute accordingly.

Print Statements: The code uses print() statements to output messages, such as the error message when an invalid size is provided and the message indicating that the shoe has been repaired.

Type Checking: The code uses the isinstance() function to check if the value parameter is an instance of the int class, ensuring that the size attribute is always an integer.
